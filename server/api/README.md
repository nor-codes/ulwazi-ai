## Local Setup Instructions

Make sure you have Python version >= 3.10. Also, install Pipenv globally on your local machine.
```bash
pip install pipenv
```

### Creating and Activating the Virtual Environment

- Install dependencies and create the virtual environment
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```
- Activate the virtual environment shell
   ```bash
   pipenv shell
    ```


The virtual environment location is managed by Pipenv and may be stored outside the project directory by default.
